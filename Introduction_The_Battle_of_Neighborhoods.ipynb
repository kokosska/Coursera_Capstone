    "Toronto -  the city of possibilities. Toronto is Canada’s largest city and a world leader in such areas as business, finance, technology, entertainment and culture. Its large population of immigrants from all over the globe has also made Toronto one of the most multicultural cities in the world. This veracity can be seen in the name of Toronto’s neighbourhoods like: Little Japan, east Chinatown, Greektown, Corso Italia and many more. What also distinguishes Toronto is the fact that it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America.  According to the information’s set at Wikipedia page the population of the city is over 6 billions. All these factors make Toronto an attractive place to live, work or start a business. What is definitely worth mentioning is the fact that thanks to the multiculturalism of this city, we are able to taste the best flavors of cuisines from around the world."
